h1. cucumber-profiler

_Currently_ _tested_ _against_ _cucumber-1.2.1_. _Is_ _known_ _not_ _to_ _be_ _compatible_ _with_ _some_ _older_ _versions_.

A way to profile the performance of your cucumber features.

The profiler groups your cucumber tests by feature. Within a feature, the profiler times each scenario and calculates the mean and standard deviation. Each scenario that is two or more standard deviations above the mean is listed.

h2. Installation

1. Put the profiler in your @Gemfile@

bc. gem cucumber-profiler

2. Use the @format@ flag to use the formatter

bc. cucumber --format Cucumber::Formatter::Profiler features

Alternatively, you can make the profiler your default format by putting the following your @cucumber.yml@ file:

bc. --format Cucumber::Formatter::Profiler

_If you use Timecop_: If you use the timecop gem to freeze or change time be sure to also return the
time after each of your tests. Not doing so will make it appear as if your tests are taking either
far too long or have taken negative time to complete.
